Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This analysis is inspired by a groundwater flow situation around the Quarry
 Lakes in Fremont (Ca) (Fig.

).
 The flow is in the two-aquifer system seems driven by the stage in the
 Quarry lakes, which shows a more or less sinuoidal fluctuation during the
 year.
 The lakes intersect the first aquifer and part of the aquitard between
 the first and the ssecond aquifer (Fig.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The head in the upper aquifer registered at some distance from the lakes
 follows this stage in a damped and delayed fashion as expected.
 The overall head is, however lower, which is believed to be due to mainly
 more ore less constant extractions from the aquifer in the area.
 The head in the second aquifer is even lower than that in the first aquifer,
 due to year-round more ore less constnat extractions in the second aquifer,
 but it closely follows that dynamics of the water level in the lakes.
 The pattern in the second aqufier is less delayed than that in the first
 aquifer as expected.
 On the other hand, the lakes-induced fluctuaiton of the head in the second
 aquifer ir larger than that of the head in the first aquifer.
 This seems counter intuitive, because the lakes is said to not penetrate
 the aquitard between the first and the second aquifer and, hence, the fluctuati
on of the head in the second aquifer should be less than that in the first
 aquifer, while the contrary is the case.
 What is likely the groundwater setting of which the measured pattern is
 the result?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most simple setting would be that of the lakes penetrating through the
 aquitard into the second aquifer, or that the lower part of the aquitard
 that the lakes have not pnetrated has far less resistance than the top
 of the aquitard that the lakes have pentrated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case the (almost) full stage signal is present under the lakes in
 both the first and the second aquifer and thus forms a head boundary condition
 near the outer circumference of the Quarry Lakes.
 Then due to a much higher storage coefficient in the first (water table)
 aquifier than in the second (semi-)confined aqufier, the lakes signal travels
 faster and with less damping through the second aquifer than it does through
 the first aquifer.
 The higher the resistance of the aquitard the farther the signal reaches
 in the second aquifer and the less mututal influence the two aquifers have.
 The larger lakes stage signal at distance in the second aquifer, despite
 the lower lakes stage signal in the first aquifer, the larger must be the
 resistance between the two aquifers and the lower must be the (elastic)
 storage coefficient in the second aquifer.
 Up to and beyond the distance between the lakes circumference and the observati
on wells where this is the case, the top aquifer seems to have negligle
 influence on the second aquifer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that the signal of the stage of the Quarry Lakes as that of the head
 in the aquifers is more or less sinuoidal, an analytic analysis is possible
 that takes advantage of this dyanmic.
 Any sine-like fluctuation of head of discharge creates an effect at distances
 that is both damped and delayed, two fundamental parameters that are open
 for analysis.
 The actual damping and delay of the head signals relative to that of the
 lakes can be obtained from overlapping the graphs.
 This is done by vertically stretching the measured head curve such that
 it best matches that of the stage of the lakes and finding the damping
 from the amount of stretching the vertical axis of the head needed to fit
 the signal of the lakes.
 The delay is obtaind by shifting the compressed curve of the measured head
 along the time axis until it best matches that of the stage of the lakes.
 This exercise is done for each and every piezometer with sufficient head
 data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a further step, the analytic analysis is done, after which the analytic
 formulas for damping and delay are matched with the field-derived damping
 and delays as described.
 The transmissivity and the storage coefficient should be derived from the
 comparison.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a last step a model is made in which the derived paramter values are
 put to see whether the model matches the dynamic head data as expected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Building the model may be tricky, because the results will be impacted by
 the shape of the aquifers.
 One obvious factor is the closed boundary formed by the mountain range
 just to the east of the Quarry Lakes.
 Another boundary will be present to the west of the lakes where a small
 mountain or hill ridge outcrops.
 This North-South running ridge may also proof almost impermeable to groundwater
 flow, and so the aquifer impacted by the Quarry Lakes may be close both
 to the east as to the west.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this analysis we will consider the combined Quarry Lakes to be a half
 circle attached to the impermeable boundary formed by the mountain range
 to the east and open to the west.
 More accurate analysis can then be done numerically by taking into account
 the real shape of the aquifers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Field data

The field data are given in the figures consisting of the dynamic stage

 well at about 1000 m from the lakes.
 The lake stage signal has been compressed as to best fit the measured head
 signal, and shifted downward to fit the aveage head and shifted along the
 time axis to fit the delay.

\begin_layout Section*
Analytical analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the approximation of the aquifers as half infinite, bounded by the
 mountains in the east and the Quarry lakes as a half circle with its center
 at this impervious boundary, we can regard the case to be analyzed as axially
 symmetric.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bruggeman (1999) presents an analytic solution for sinusoidal discharge
 by a well in an axially symmetric setting.
 Every sinusoidal discharge at frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 yields sinusoidal head and discharge fluctuations at any distance from
 the well which are damped and delayed depending on the aquifer parameters
 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\sqrt{\frac{S}{kD}}$
\end_inset

 and the frequency.
 These are, in fact, the only parmaters that matter in a confined aquifer,
 which is what we're focussing on, given that the mutual influence between
 the two aquifer seems negligible, at least somewhat beyond the distance
 of the obervation wells of which we obtained the dynamic head data.
 For the analysis of damping and delay between points at different distances,
 the actual discharge drops out of the equation as well has the difference
 between a circular lake penetrating the aqufier at a given radius and the
 head at a different radius.
 If we consider the lake stage as a boundary condition at distance 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{lake}$
\end_inset

 then what happens for 
\begin_inset Formula $r<R_{lake}$
\end_inset

 stays out of the equation and does not affect the following analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bruggeman's (1999) solution number 215.08 (p.
 158) considers a well with sinusoidally fluctuation discharge with a maximum
 amplitude of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{0}$
\end_inset

 and frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=2\pi/T$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

is the cycle time, in our case 365 days.
 The solution uses complex numbers to deal with the cycling and reads
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\phi\left(r,t\right)\text{=}\frac{Q_{0}}{2\pi kD}\Im\left[e^{i\omega t}K_{0}\left(\beta r\sqrt{i\omega}\right)\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This implies that the amplitude of the head at 
\begin_inset Formula $r=r$
\end_inset

 is given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Phi\left(r\right)=\frac{Q_{0}}{2\pi kD}\left|K_{0}\left(\beta r\sqrt{i\omega}\right)\right|=\frac{Q_{0}}{2\pi kD}K_{0}\left(\beta r\sqrt{\omega}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, the delay is then obtaind from the angle of
\end_layout

\[
angle=-\angle\left[K_{0}\left(\beta r\sqrt{i\omega}\right)\right]
\]

\begin_layout Standard
Expressed in days, the delay

 is then

T_{delay}\left(r\right)=\frac{\angle\left[K_{0}\left(\beta r\sqrt{i\omega}\right)\right]}{\omega}

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 may be named spreadingslength exactly as in the case of semi-confined flow.
 Compare this envelope with the stationary head in a semi-confined then
 gives the following spreadings length for the current dynamic head dampoing:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{r}{\lambda}=\beta r\sqrt{\omega}=\lambda=\frac{1}{\beta\sqrt{\omega}}=\sqrt{\frac{kD}{\omega S}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda=\sqrt{\frac{kD}{\omega S}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This clearly show that the damping increases with frequency and storage
 coefficient and decreases with transmissivty.
 From semi-confined flow we know that the bessel fucntion is essentially
 zero for 
\begin_inset Formula $r>3\lambda$
\end_inset

, which, therefore is also the case in this dynamic situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Using the field data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking into account the field data for which only 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 must be estimated, then if we assume the situation in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Situation-Quarry-Lake"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is sufficiently representative and the uncertain impervious boundary in
 the west can be ignored.
 We have a circular lakes area with a radius of about 600 m.
 Then the first observation well is at about 
\begin_inset Formula $r=1600$
\end_inset

 m, i.e.
 about 1000 m from the circumference of the Lake area and the second observation
 wel at about 
\begin_inset Formula $r=5000$
\end_inset

 m, in the order of 4200 m from the circumference of the lake area.
 Using 
\begin_inset Formula $kD=500$
\end_inset

 m2/d as an estimate, we can then compute both the amplitude of the signal
 in the aquifer as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 for different values of the storagen coefficient.
 The compression of the signal between points, i.e.
 the damping then is the ratio of the signal at different distances.
 The damping between the face of the Lakes at 
\begin_inset Formula $r=600$
\end_inset

 m and the first observation well at 
\begin_inset Formula $r=1600$
\end_inset

 m is shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Damping-of-the-amplitude"

\end_inset

.
 Also the damping between 
\begin_inset Formula $r=1600$
\end_inset

 m and 
\begin_inset Formula $r=5000$
\end_inset

 m is shown in the figure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the actual damping derived from overlaying the signal in the first observatio
n well and the lakes was found to be 0.56 (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Lake-stage-signal-1000m"

\end_inset

), we see that this matches with a storage coefficient a little above 0.1
 for the first aquifer, which is reasonable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Futhermmore, the damping in the second aquifer was found to be 0.74 (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The signals (stage-time or head-time series) of the stage (water level)
 of the lakes and the piezometer values (heads) in an observation well at
 about 1000 m from the lakes were compared to derive the actual damping
 and delay between that of the lakes and that in the groundwater.
 The analysis can be done analytically to obtain an estimate of the strorage
 coefficient.
 In this case this is true for that of the first and that of the second
 aquifer, because the aquifers hardly influence each other so that the signal
 is fully dominated by the fluctuation of the water level in the lakes.
 Since the water level in the lakes fluctuates almost like a yearly sine-wave,
 analytical analysis was possible assuming the lake signal spreads radially
 outward.
 This axially symmetric situation is distorted by at least one impervious
 boundary to the aquifer, caused by the presensce of the mountain rainge
 passing closely by the lakes.
 This permits to see the situation as half-infinite which still allows an
 axially symmetric analysis.
 It may be that there is also an impervious boundary about 6 km to the west
 of the lakes, as an small north-south outcrop parallel to the Bay can be
 seen on Google Earth.
 This would hamper applying the analytical analysis to observation wells
 farther to the west and at larger distances from the lakes.
 Such details to be taken into account requires a numerical model.

The conclusion that can be drawn from this analysis is, that to transform
 the signal of the water level in the lakes to that of the head in the observati
on well at 1000 m from the lakes circumference, a damping and delay is required
 that stems from normal subsurface parameter values, i.e.
 transmissivity and storage coefficent.
 This is true for both the signal in the shallow first aquifer and for that
 in the deeper second aquifer.
 The observation that the fluctuation in the second aquifer at 1000 m from
 the lakes is larger than that in the first aquifer, is, therefore, perfectly
 consistent with normal groundwater hydraulics.

\begin_layout Standard
The point to doubt, though, is the allegaton that the lakes do not penetrate
 the second aquifer.
 If this assertion is true, then it is likely that the the lakes either
 at least partially penetrate the aquitard or that vertical resistance of
 the aquitard between the two aquifers is dominantly in its penetrated top
 rather than in its unpenetrated bottom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The higher signal amplitue in the second aquifer at 1000 m from the lakes
 compared to that in the first aquifer, shows that the resitance of the
 aquitard is so large that the two aquifers behave virtually independently.
 This resistance cannot be present below the lakes, as it would make the
 large siginal in the second aquifer below the lakes impossible.
