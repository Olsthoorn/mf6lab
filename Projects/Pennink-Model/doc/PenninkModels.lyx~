Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pennink wanted to estimate the capacity of the dune area nowadays called
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Amsterdam Water Supply Dunes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for the drinking water supply of the Dutch capital.
 He also feared complete loss of the area for drinking water supply due
 to intrusion and upconing of salt water present in the adjacent North sea
 and below a depth of around 80 to 120 m, if the area was overexploited
 due to ever growing demand for good water.
 Since the water extraction started in 1853 with pumping from a dug pond
 an ever extending network of extraction canals had been dug in the due
 area to keep up with demand.
 Already around 1880 the capacity limit was hit as virtually all yearly
 precipitation surplus was captured by the canal system.
 A decades long intense discussion on what to do about is set in.
 It led among others to forced measures like dug drains below some canal
 bottoms, but without avail.
 Pennink, how became director of the Amsterdam Water Supply in 1998 was
 also civil engineer interested in groundwater hydrology.
 He took it upon himself to figure out the true capacity of the dune area
 and the risk of saltwater intrusion to prevent loss of the area due to
 salinization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the then recent work by Badon-Ghijben and Herzberg, Pennink knew about
 the behavior of salt water in direct contact with fresh water under extraction.
 Quantifying it, however was a different matter, which might be solved by
 doing tests in the laboratory with a physical cross section model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To quantify the potential water extraction from the dune area it was necessary
 to understand groundwater flow towards the recovery canals.
 Pennnink's computations of this flow did not match with the know hydraulic
 conductivity of the dune sand and the flow depth that was then thought
 not to extend below the bottom of the extraction canals.
 At the beginning of the 20th century, it was neither generally known nor
 accepted that groundwater should stream below canal bottoms, let alone
 that it would flow upward near them.
 The confusion is said to be due to a then important book called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Die Wasserversorgung der St√§dte
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (The water supply for cities) (ref ###) in which the author, professor
 at ###, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

proved mathematically
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that groundwater flowing towards canals could not flow below their bottom
 elevation.
 However, the actual flow extracted by the recovery canals in the Amsterdam
 Dune Area, turned out the be much larger than what would match with the
 flow through thickness between groundwater table and canal bottom and the
 known hydraulic condutivity.
 It is believed that this descrepancy between the then standing theory and
 practical experience triggered Pennink to persue this riddle by physical
 modeling in the laboratory and with field measurements around a recovery
 canal in the due area, rather than to challenge the widely used renowned
 German book on the basis of theoretical arguments alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Pennink's models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pennink had two physical cross-sectional models made; one for single-density
 flow had a size of 60x60 cm and one for dual density flow which was 90x90
 cm, both filled with fine gravel between two glass plates that were 2 cm
 apart.
 Boundary heads could be maintained at one or two sides using a gazed ditch
 inserted in the gravel, while precipitation was introduced by means of
 a gutter on top with a series of equidistant holes to let the water drop
 on top of the gravel.
 To show the flow, ink could be injected at certain points using small tubes
 injected into the gravel to given depths.
 On the other hand, density flow was visualized by using milk as the heavier
 fluid, which happens to have about the same density as salt water, while
 being clearly visible through the glass.
 The milk hardly mixed with the fresh water on top, which is likely due
 to the milk being fatty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Pennink's first set of model runs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pennink ran various series of runs with his models.
 The first series of experiments focused on single density flow and on the
 paths of precipitation travelling underground towards extraction canals.
 Further series simulated the simultaneous behavior of fresh water and salt
 water, for which Pennink used milk.
\end_layout

 The water flow from canal

 to the outflowing canal

.
 The maintained water levels in the canals are connected by a white line.
 There must be a full capillary zone a few cm above line AB, which was ignored
 by Pennink.
 However, its top is vaguely visible on the photo, delimting a lighter unsaturat
ed and the darker colored saturated zone.
 Maintaining a head difference in both

 forced the flow from B to A through the model.
 To show the streamlines, 5 small glass tubes were inserted in the sand
 from above to different depth, allowing black ink to be infiltrated.

 shows the flow from the ends of the five glass tubes 55 minutes after ink
 was introduced.
 The patterns shows that the bottom of the shallowest tube ends in the unsaturat
ed zone while that of the second tube ends at the top of the full capillary
 zone.
 The flow in the full capillary zone is as fast as around the line AB, while
 that in the unsaturated zone is much less, lower the lower the saturation.
 The spot made by the shallowest tube is also less dark due to the presence
 of air in the unsaturated zone.The thickness of the full capillary zone

\begin_inset Formula $\rho g\approx10^{4}N/m^{3}$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h\approx0.04m$
\end_inset

.
 With this, we get

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

 being the radius of an equivalent glass tube in which the suction height
 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is computed.
 The diameter of equivalent glass grains with around 35% porosity would
 be around 10 times this size, i.e.
 around 4 mm.
 This indeed, implies that Pennink used very coarse sand to very find gravel,
 as one may already have guessed given the visible grains in the Photo.
 The hydraulic conductivity of the medium in Penninks laboratory model is,
 therefore, much higher than that of fine dune sand of around 8-10 m/d.
 We will determine the conductivity of the laboratory model later one from
 modelling Pennink's experiments.

 behind of the ink in the unsaturated zone, where there is vertually no

 The sharp contrast of the water velocity at the boundary of the unsaturated

 the model, there is hardly a transition zone.
 The figure allows to estimate the horizontal flow velocity in the unsaturated
 zone to be about 1/4th to 1/5th of that of the top of the saturated zone.

 The inflow at the canal of the streamline approaching along the op of the

 A seepage face is special boundary outflow condition along which head and
 elevation are the same.

\begin_layout Section
Upward flow below extraction canals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pennink's book thus starts with field observations which he used to verify
 the the laboratory experiments with his physical cross sectional model,
 which had just shown that flow lines near an extraction canal point upward.
 Pennink had three series of 5 to 5 small piezometers installed vertically
 1 to 1.5 m apart, at 0, 5, 10 and 15 m from the center line of 4 m wide
 extracting canal.
 A rather impervious clay layer prevented vertical flow at about 8 below
 the canal stage.
 This setup of 19 piezometers allowed mapping the spatial head distribution
 near the canal with great accuracy.
 Pennink used these measurements to draw lines of equal head in the cross
 section and also drow streamlines more or less perpendicular to them.
 This way, the upward flow near the canal, due to contracting streamlines,
 was demonstrated to exist in the field as it did in the laboratory model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is tempting with the tools of today, to regenerate the flow field that
 Pennink came up with.

Nowadays, modeling the flow in and streamlines in the Pennink's lab model
