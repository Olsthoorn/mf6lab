\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This implies that if disperision works as in this generally appied theory,
 that then the dispersive dilution both in front of and behind of average position of the moving front would be similar to molecular diffusion,
 i.e.
 as if it was driven by concentration gradients,
 and that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{L}$
\end_inset

 would be proportional to the root of the traveled distance.
 Furthermore,
 the head and the tail of the front would be symmetrical with respect to the average location of the moving front.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As De Lange found that these aspects do not comply with the findings of most field studies carried out throughout the world,
 which I demonstrates by comparing the reported values from these studies,
 he challenges these basic assumptions in his papers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Assumptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wim has recognized from his own experience that,
 in practice,
 dispersion does not comply with the theory outlined above.
 He has been inspired by the work of Jankovic (2003,
 2006 etc) who focused on dispersion fully based on flow velocity differences caused by heterogeneities present in the aquifer,
 so velocity differences between subsurface pathlines that are caused only by advective transport through a porous medium with a heterogeneous conductivity field in which the size of the heterogeneities are of the order of meters and not of that of the pores or the size of the grains.
 He further basis his theory on the obsevation that in natural aquifers,
 conductivity contrasts that form the hetergeneities,
 often have lengths of the size of many to to tens of meters,
 which easily exceed their vertical size by an order of magnitude.
 From this he concludes that the main subsurface mixing process causing apparent dispersion at the macro scale is advection distored by the presence of such elongated heterogeneities,
 facies as know to geologists and sedimentologists.
 These facies,
 which are repeatedly encountered by groundwater flowing through the subsurace with have different size and conductivities.
 Part of them will have conductivities higher to perhaps much higher than the average of the aquifer,
 while another part will have conductivties that are lower to much lower than the average of the aquifer.
 The range of conductivities present in the aquifer is mostly defined by the lognormal distribution of sampled conductivity values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Lange shows how this mixing works for a single elongated heteregeneity with a conductivity that constrasts with the uniform conductivity of the background aquifer.
 He the shows that impact this heteregeneity has on the shape of the front in the case of a high-conductive heterogeneity differs fundamentally from that of the distortion of the shape of the front caused by the presence of a low-conductive hetergeneity.
 The high-conductive elongated heterogeneity mainly causes a relatively wide foward bulb of the front with a small slow-down of the rest.
 The low-conductive elongated heterogeneity leaves the bulk of the front intact but distorts it by generating a long tail.
 The combined effect of an elongated high conductive heterogeneity and an elongated low-conductive heterogeneity is a distorted front that is higly asymmetrical around its average moving position.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
De lange goes on to quantify seperately the two distortions,
 i.e.
 that of the head and the tail of the moving front.
 In his concept the front distortion is stable from some point after the high-conductive heterogeneity,
 where the flow has regained its unifromity.
 The tail distortion,
 however,
 will extend over potentially much larger distances after the bulk of the groundwater has passed the low-conductive heterogeneity.
 The lower its conductivity,
 the longer (and thinner) the tail-distortion of the nitially flat front.
 This fundamentally different behavior caused by relative conductivity determines the asymmetry of front distortion encountered in real-world situations,
 and is caused purely by advection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Real-world aquifers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the real-world situaiton,
 there are many heterogeneities of these types,
 each with a different conductivity and with a different length and thickness.
 Therefore,
 to generalize the concept,
 the connection with the actual real-world aquifer conductivity field has to be made.
 De Lange accepts the idea that,
 as an approximation to reality,
 the conductivy sampled in a real-world aquifer generally shows a lognormal probability distribution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way to jump from his concept to the real-world aquifer would be superposition.
 I.e.
 super-imposing the effect of many such heterogeneities which got the properties assigned based on the lognormal distribution of the conductivity sampled in the real aquifer while honoring their semi-variograms in both horizontal direction(s).
 However,
 it's not clear that superpostion is could be valid when applied to travel-time distortions.
 But perhaps it is in some sense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
De Lange simply says,
 without proof,
 that when the bulk conductivity of the aquifer is taken equal to the geometric mean of the conductivty distribution and that of the elongated k-contrasting heterogeneity is taken equal to that at 
\begin_inset Formula $+\sigma$
\end_inset

 for the high-conductive heterogeneity and at 
\begin_inset Formula $-\sigma$
\end_inset

 for the low-conductive one,
 the behavior of his model reflects that of the real-world aquifer.
 Hence he says,
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 the standard deviation of the undelying normal distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln\left(k\right)$
\end_inset

 the the geometric mean of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{g}$
\end_inset

,
 or,
 equivalently,
 the additive mean of 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln k$
\end_inset

 equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln k_{g}$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\ln\frac{k_{+\sigma}}{k_{g}}=\ln k_{+\sigma}-\ln k_{g}=\sigma
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and so
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
k_{+\sigma} & =\exp\left(\ln\left(k_{g}\right)+\sigma\right)\\
k_{-\sigma} & =\exp\left(\ln\left(k_{g}\right)-\sigma\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other step to be made from reality to model is the translation of real-world integration lengths or semi-variogram ranges to the conceptual model.
 He describes the plume,
 where in fact,
 he is describing the distortion of an initially flat front.
 The distortion of the front caused by high-conductive zone in domain 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta s_{Af}$
\end_inset

,
 that of caused by the low-conductive heterogeneity is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta s_{At}$
\end_inset

.
 The length causing the distortion is the length over which the flow across the vertical is 
\begin_inset Quotes pld
\end_inset

clearly
\begin_inset Quotes prd
\end_inset

 not uniform.
 The distortion lenght can be derived and estimated by hand-calculation.
 Dropping index 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 for convenience we get
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta s_{f}=\left(1-\frac{k_{g}}{k_{+\sigma}}\right)L_{dis,f}
\]

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta s_{t}=\left(1-\frac{k_{g}}{k_{-\sigma}}\right)L_{dis,t}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{g}\ll k_{+\sigma}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{g\gg}k_{-\sigma}$
\end_inset

 we get
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta s_{f}\approx L_{dis,f}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta s_{t}\approx-\frac{k_{g}}{k_{-\sigma}}L_{dis,t}=-e^{-\sigma}L_{dis,t}

 illustrates that the length of the forward bulge in the front after passing an elongated high-conductive zone is about the length os this zone,
 whereas it is much longer for the backward tail in the front after passing the low-condutive zone.
 The length of this tail matches the 5 times lower than bulk conductivity of this latter zone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the same way,
 the thicknes of the wake,
 or the vertical spread,
 which can also be derived and hand-calculated.
 Then,
 leaving out the ratio of the porisities (assuming this ration 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx1$
\end_inset

),
 then becomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{W_{f}}{D}=\frac{1}{1+\frac{k_{g}}{k_{+\sigma}}\left(\frac{1}{N}-1\right)}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{W_{t}}{D}=\frac{1}{1+\frac{k_{g}}{k_{-\sigma}}\left(\frac{1}{N}-1\right)}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{g}\ll k_{+\sigma}$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{f}\rightarrow D$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{g}/k_{+\sigma}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 and with 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{g}\gg k_{-\sigma}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{t}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{k}/k_{-\sigma}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

.
 Hence the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{dis,t}\rightarrow L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{dis,f}\rightarrow L+2D$
\end_inset

 or any value between 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L+2D$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the length of domain 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is considered equal to the length over which the mixing is completed,
 it should equal 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{dis,f}$
\end_inset

,
 but for the tail it would be much larger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point,
 it's still not clear how the length of the fundamental mixing box,
 named domain A is determined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point,
 we still don't know how mixing occurs in the real aquifer with many zones within each zone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Construction of the proper cross section
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To construct a cross section that complies with the concept developed by De Lange (2020,
 2022),
 we have to choose domains A with 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 a bout 6 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{h}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 about 6 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{v}$
\end_inset

,
 given the hint by De Lange that the scale factor 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is about 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{A}=2\lambda_{h}N$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{A}=2\lambda_{v}N$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{h}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{N}$
\end_inset

 the horizontal and vertical correlations lengths.
 But what is not clear,
 is how to include both the low conductivity zone and the high conductivity zone in a single domain or,
 for that matter,
 a single cross section?
 I could just generate the cross section with two zones in each domain,
 one low-k and one high-k zone and position them at random within each domain.
 Or,
 generate mixing boxes with either a high-k or a low-k zone in them and randomly position these boxes in the cross section.
 Of one could split the aquifer in two parts,
 an upper half and a lower half,
 and fill the upper half with high-k domains and the lower half with low-k domains,
 and afterwards collect all the particles.
 But at the same time,
 we would like to maintain the transmissivity of the entire aquifer the same.
 It is not clear how to do this,
 except for running the model and use the computed flow to scale back the result.
 But then we'll loose the link with the lognormal distribution of the real-world aquifer.
 Therefore,
 in fact,
 I have no clue of how to do this.
 The most logical approach in my opinion,
 is to use a conductivity field that is generated with the given real-world aquifer correlation lengths and its lognormal conductivity distribution,
 which is in fact,
 what I did already.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I conclude,
 the simulation with the random conductivity field,
 with the correct correlation lengths and conductivity,
 probability is the conductivity field that should generate the most realistic breakthrough curves,
 which then should be in accordance with De Lange's conceptual model.

 writes 
\begin_inset Quotes pld
\end_inset

In each domain (mixing box) the dispersion process is averaged leasing to linear growth of the plume.
\begin_inset Quotes prd
\end_inset

 I don't yet see that this exactly means.
 Averaging is mxing,
 which is what a mixing box is supposed to do.
 However,
 the analysis until now just handled what is happening in a single box due to passing an single inhomogeneity.
 I would expect an analysis of the shape of the cumulative probability density distribution of the pollutant concentration leaving the box,
 when the shape was sharp at the front of left side of the box.
 Once we have this,
 we could place many such boxes next to each other and observe or compute change the shape of the cdf after each box passed.
 We can then analyze this using the theory developed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 in his thesis.
 This would seem to me a straight-forward exercise because the math lies ready,
 at least for indepent successive mixing boxes.
 I suspect the variances should be added,
 same increment after each box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maas proves this in chapter 2 of his thesis.
 He also proves that,
 with successive mixing boxes passed,
 the mean distance increases linearly as does the variance of the break-through curves.
 The result approaches a Gaussian or normal type of breakthrough after an infinite number of boxes passed.
 On page 16,
 he addresses the fact that breakthrough curves of practical tests are often considerably skewed.
 Which,
 when it happens,
 implies that the Gaussian limit has not yet been reached.
 In fact,
 this is the subject of De Lange's papers.
 Maas refers to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 who fitted longitudinal dispersion,
 which he found to be definitivily non-Gaussian.
 Maas continues to elaborate the skewness of breakthrough functions and finally finds the Pearson type III distribution as a modification of the generalized gamma distribution (Abramowitz and Stegun,
 1964,
 p255).
 This Pearson III distribution has only 3 degrees of freedom and generates breakthrough curves (i.e.
 cdfs) that are very skewed for early times and then,
 with increaring time,
 gradually evolve towards the normal distribution as the cenral limit theorem demands (Figure

 Maas writes that the gamma distribution along with the lognormal distribution have been proposed earlier by

.
 They speak about Travel Time Probability Density Functions and regard them as an integral soil property to be measured in the field.
 I like to agree with their conclusion and I would say that we can measure this propertie also in the model by letting particles flow through a given conductivity field with predescribed properties (and compare it with physical experiments,
 of course).

Key Messages from de Lange's Work:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Advective Transport as a Primary Mechanism:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
De Lange emphasizes that dispersion in groundwater is predominantly governed by advective processes resulting from aquifer heterogeneity,
 rather than solely by diffusive mechanisms.
 He illustrates how variations in hydraulic conductivity within aquifers lead to differences in flow velocities,
 causing spreading of solute plumes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Asymmetry in Plume Development:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His studies highlight the asymmetric nature of plume dispersion,
 where the plume front and tail develop differently due to the presence of high and low conductivity zones.
 High-conductivity zones tend to accelerate the plume front,
 while low-conductivity zones retard the tail,
 leading to an uneven spread that traditional models may not accurately capture.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Introduction of the Macroscale Dispersion Correlation Coefficient (r):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
De Lange introduces a correlation coefficient to quantify the degree of dependency in dispersion across successive domains within an aquifer.
 This parameter helps in understanding whether dispersion processes are independent or correlated,
 which has implications for predicting plume behavior over larger scales.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Practical Tools for Field Application
\series default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recognizing the need for accessible methods in engineering practice,
 de Lange provides analytical expressions and tools,
 such as spreadsheets,
 to calculate dispersivities and plume spreads.
 These tools are designed to be user-friendly for practitioners dealing with real-world groundwater contamination issues.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary,
 de Lange's work advocates for a shift towards models that incorporate advective transport phenomena and aquifer heterogeneity to better understand and predict dispersion in groundwater systems.
 His contributions offer both theoretical insights and practical tools for engineers and hydrogeologists.\SpecialChar allowbreak

In W.J.
 de Lange's 2020 and 2022 publications in Ground Water,

Determination of Scale Factor N
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the mathematical relationship between domain A's dimensions and the correlation lengths is clearly defined,
 the specific value or method for determining the scale factor N is not explicitly detailed in the available publications.
 The choice of N likely depends on factors such as the degree of heterogeneity in the aquifer,
 the scale of interest for modeling,
 and the desired resolution of the simulation.
 In practice,
 N may be selected based on empirical data,
 calibration against observed breakthrough curves,
 or sensitivity analyses to ensure that the model accurately captures the dispersion behavior observed in the field.

Question 3 to ChatGPT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
De Lange in his two papers seems step from the real world from which he gets his lognormal distributed conductivities to his conceptual model,
 which is definitely not the real world.
 I would like to know what the underlying logic of plausibility is te make such a step,
 so that the conceptual model will bear a strong link to reality.
 The other factors are of course the length scales he uses and the real world origin of those.
 Can you help me figure this out?

\begin_layout Standard
W.J.
 de Lange's framework,
 as presented in his 2020 and 2022 Ground Water publications,
 bridges real-world aquifer heterogeneity with a conceptual model to elucidate and quantify asymmetric breakthrough curves resulting from groundwater flow through heterogeneous conductivity fields.
 Central to this framework is the concept of "domain A," a representative volume within the aquifer designed to encapsulate the effects of local heterogeneities on solute transport.

Constructing the Conceptual Model:
 Domain A
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In de Lange's model,
 the aquifer is partitioned into repeating units termed "domain 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

." Each domain contains a discrete,
 elongated zone with contrasting hydraulic conductivity,
 reflecting the natural variability observed in real aquifers.
 The dimensions of these domains are directly linked to the aquifer's statistical properties:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* Horizontal dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $(L_{a}):L_{a}=2\lambda_{h}N$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* Vertical dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $(D_{a}):D_{a}=2\lambda_{v}N$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{h}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{v}$
\end_inset

 represent the horizontal and vertical correlation lengths of the hydraulic conductivity field,
 respectively,
 and N is a scale factor determining the size of domain A relative to these correlation lengths.
 This scaling ensures that each domain 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 encompasses a conductivity zone of size 
\begin_inset Formula $2\lambda_{h}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $2\lambda_{v}$
\end_inset

,
 effectively capturing the local heterogeneity's influence on flow and transport.

\begin_layout Standard
De Lange's approach ensures that the conceptual model maintains a strong connection to real-world aquifer behavior by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Statistical Grounding:
 Utilizing statistical parameters (mean,
 variance,
 correlation lengths) derived from field data to define the properties of domain 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Physical Representation:
 Modeling the effects of discrete conductivity zones within each domain to replicate the impact of heterogeneities on solute transport.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Scalable Design:
 Employing the scale factor 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 to adjust the size of domain 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

,
 allowing the model to be tailored to different scales of heterogeneity and ensuring that it remains representative of the actual aquifer conditions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By integrating these elements,
 the conceptual model serves as a simplified yet robust representation of the complex processes governing solute dispersion in heterogeneous aquifers.
