# Wim's aquifer

The idea is to create a cross sectional aquifer to analyze dispersion in the way Wim de Langs has studied it for a long time.

I do believe that if the aquifer, even an artifical one, has the properties that Wim thinks real aquifers have, it should be possible to show
how flow and particles behave and, from this, how macrodispersion develops over time.

The idea here is to generate one or more aquifers by geostatistics or other means that will have the correct statistical properties and simulate
particle transport in it.

We set up a simple rectangular cross sectional cross section long enough, thick enough and detailed enough to allow simulating the presumed
dispersion behavior and do particle tracking in it, possibly using thousands of particles.
